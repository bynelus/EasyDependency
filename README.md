- [Usage](#usage)

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

- Swift 5.0

## Installation

EasyDependency is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'EasyDependency', '~> 2.0'
```

## Summary

EasyDependency is a very lightweight dependency injection framework, without magic. Just a container to register and resolve dependencies.
There is no focus on adding support for circular dependencies or automatic injection of dependencies. Simplicity is key.

## Features

- [x] Register & retrieve dependencies from a DI container.
- [x] Resolve list of implementations.
- [x] Register dependencies as singletons.
- [x] Schedule jobs based on a dependency.

## Usage

### Create dependency container

```swift
import EasyDependency

class AppContainer: Container {
    var superContainer: Container?
    var registrations: [Any] = []
    var logging: Bool = false

    required init(container: Container? = nil) {
        self.superContainer = container
    }
}
```

### Register a dependency

This way you register an implementation on a protocol.

```swift
let appContainer = AppContainer()
try appContainer.register(Storage.self) { _ in StorageAImpl() }
try appContainer.register(Storage.self) { _ in StorageBImpl() }
try appContainer.register(Storage.self, .lazySingleton) { _ in StorageBImpl() }
```

### Retrieve a dependency

You can retrieve the implementation by resolve the dependency by its interface.

```swift
let storageImplementation: Storage? = try? appContainer.resolve()
let storageList: [Storage] = appContainer.resolveList()
```

### Feature containers

You can create feature containers including the super container. Registrations on the feature container are used in favor of the super container.

```swift
let appContainer = AppContainer()
try appContainer.register(Storage.self) { _ in StorageAImpl() }
try appContainer.register(String.self) { _ in "StringExample" }

let featureContainer = FeatureContainer(container: appContainer)
try featureContainer.register(Storage.self) { container in StorageBImpl(string: try container.resolve()) }
let storageImplementation: Storage? = try? featureContainer.resolve() // StorageBImpl() will be returned.
```

### Schedule jobs

You can also schedule a job based on a certain interval. This works together with [Schedule](http://https://github.com/luoxiu/Schedule), so a very elegant way of scheduling tasks based on a certain dependency.

```swift
let appContainer = AppContainer()
try appContainer.register(String.self) { _ in "StringExample" }

appContainer.schedule(type: String.self, in: 5.seconds, repeating: 5.minutes, queue: .global()) { textValue in
	guard let textValue = textValue else { return }
	print("Execute on our string: \(textValue)") // Will be printed after 5 seconds and every 5 minutes after.
}
```
